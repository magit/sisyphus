(defvar sisyphus-non-release-bump-header nil
  "Whether to bump the `Version'/`Package-Version' header for non-releases.

MELPA prefers release tags over the versions specified using the
`Version' or `Package-Version' library header, and for packages
that are only distributed on MELPA, I strongly recommend that you
do not add this header at all.

Elpa-Admin, the tool used to maintain GNU ELPA and NonGNU ELPA,
relies exclusively on the version header, making it mandatory to
set that header, if a package is to be distributed there.

The functions, which Emacs uses to compare version strings, only
support release and pre-release version strings.  Contrary to
what you might expect, they, for example, consider \"1.0-git\" to
be smaller than 1.0.  That makes it very difficult to bump the
version header after a release in order for it not to provide
incorrect information.

As it stands, we are left with two unsatisfactory options to deal
with the version header after a release.

1) We leave the header untouched until the next release.  This is
   very unfortunate because it means that every commit in between
   the releases N and N+1 will claim to actually be N.

   I regret having to knowingly provide incorrect information,
   but after years of refining the workaround that is the other
   option, I have given up, and now recommend you too just learn
   to live with this unfortunate situation as well.  (But again,
   if your package is not distributed on GNU ELPA or NonGNU ELPA,
   just avoid this situation by not adding this header at all.)

2) We bump the header in the first commit after a release by
   appending a suffix that is understood by Emacs and Elpa-Admin,
   and hopefully humans alike, as signifying a development
   snapshot that comes after the named release.

   Unfortunately, due to a series of blunders in how these tools
   work, this results in very ugly and long version strings.

   The suffix must contain something like \"-git\", because without
   such a pre-release suffix Elpa-Admin would mistake the \"this
   is not a release\" suffix for just another release.

   Because N-git is considered to be smaller than N, we have to
   additionally either inject a numeric part in between the release
   N and the suffix to fake post-release syntax, or bump N as well.

   a) Faking post-release syntax: Unlike N-git, N.50-git is greater
      than N.  Note that N.0-git would not work because N.0 is equal
      to N, so N.0-git too is smaller than N.

      Having to use such a noisy suffix is bad enough, but
      unfortunately Elpa-Admin then turns it into something even
      uglier.  \"1.2.3.50-git\", for example, becomes something like
      \"1.2.3.50-snapshot0.20230813.123456\".

      To use this approach you have to set two variables:

         (setq sisyphus-non-release-bump-header t)
         (setq sisyphus-non-release-suffix \".50-git\")

   b) Bumping version strings after release:  Given a release \"1.2.3\",
      bump the least significant part before appending a pre-release
      suffix: \"1.2.4-git\".

      It is important that you always bump the least significant part.
      If you bump another part, for example to \"1.3.0-git\", then you
      cannot later decide to release \"1.2.4\", without all snapshot
      releases that were previously labeled \"1.3.0-git...\" to be
      considered larger than the \"1.2.4\" release that follows them.

      To use this approach you have to set two variables:

         (setq sisyphus-non-release-bump-header t)
         (setq sisyphus-non-release-suffix \"-git\")

      Beside appending the specified suffix, this automatically bumps
      the least significant part of the version string of the
      preceding release.

A package may embed version strings in other places beside the
version header, in manuals, for example.  I recommend that you add a
post-release suffix to these version strings after a release.  Because
these version strings are not used by Emacs, we can ignore that Emacs
does not support post-release version strings.

Given the default values of `sisyphus-non-release-suffix' and this
variable, the command `sisyphus-bump-post-release' bumps all embedded
version strings by appending \"-devel\", except for the version in the
version library header, which it leaves untouched.")

(defvar sisyphus-non-release-suffix "-devel"
  "String appended to version strings for non-release revisions.
Depending on the value of `sisyphus-non-release-bump-header'
\(which see), this suffix is appended to all embedded version
strings, or to all except for the `Version'/`Package-Version'
header.")

(defvar sisyphus-changelog-file "CHANGELOG"
  "The file that contains the changelog.")

(defvar sisyphus-changelog-entry-regexp "^\\* v\\([^ ]+\\) +\\(.+\\)$"
  "Regexp used to match the beginning of an entry in a changelog file.

The file is searched from the beginning.  I.e., it is assumed
that the first entry concerns either the unreleased development
version or the latest release.

The first match group must match the version string, without any
prefix such as \"v\".  The second match group must match a date
string.

The default value matches Org mode headings like these:

* v2.0.0    UNRELEASED

Description of upcoming changes.

* v1.0.0    2024/01/05

Description of changes in v1.0.0.

The regexp specified here, must match the format specified by
`sisyphus-changelog-heading-format'.")
